Goal of the game: 
- Get the rectangular 3D box to fall into the square hole located somewhere on the geometric plane for each level
- There is 33 levels, each increasingly more challenging than the one before it

Rules of the game:
- Moving on the geomatric plane is possible by using arrow keys for up, down, left and right.
- DO NOT fall of the surfice
- *Orange tiles* are fragile and if the block stands vertically atop an orange square the block will fall through
- Switches:
  - *Soft switches* activate any time any part of the block presses it
  - *Hard switches* require your block to stand upright on top of it to activate.
  - *Teleport switches* allow your block to teleport to different locations on the plane by splitting it into two smaller blocks.
